# Brainstorming Process - Smart Features

The brainstorming process started by identifying potential smart features that combine sensors and data to improve the user experience. In parallel, we reflected on common mobility problems faced by university students when commuting from home to campus in order to propose ideas that could address these issues. As a group, we also discussed existing informal solutions, such as students offering rides to other students at lower prices than traditional transportation options.

Each idea was proposed openly and discussed in terms of feasibility, value for students, and potential to solve recurring issues such as lack of payment, poor coordination, delays, and unclear communication. After the discussion, we shortlisted the most promising ideas.

We then organized these ideas using a simple clustering method, comparing their potential impact and feasibility.

As described previously and following the techniques learned in class, we first conducted a group brainstorming session where all members contributed ideas. These ideas were captured using a virtual whiteboard, where we deliberately avoided using “but” and instead adopted the “yes, and” approach to encourage idea expansion. Each group member added their proposals to a shared virtual Padlet, as shown below:

Next, we carried out a convergence step in which similar or repeated ideas were combined, and others were selected based on team voting. Ideas that overlapped significantly were removed, and the remaining ones were classified into the categories “Rational Choice,” “Most Likely to Delight,” “The Darling,” and “The Long Shot.”:

# Decision Process - The idea for the semester

The final idea for the semester, Wheels, was selected through a divergence and convergence process, following the ideation techniques learned in class. During the divergence phase, the team generated multiple ideas using the “Yes, and” approach to encourage open discussion and creativity. Examples of generated ideas included a student-to-student ride service, a centralized app for coordinating rides, real-time location tracking, reliability scoring for drivers and passengers, and notification systems for arrivals and payments.

In the convergence phase, the team discussed these ideas **verbally** and grouped related concepts, combining complementary features and discarding overlapping ones. Rather than using written post-it notes, the team relied on structured discussion guided by feasibility, relevance to student mobility problems, and alignment with insights obtained from the interviews. A final decision was reached through team voting, ensuring that all members participated equally in the selection process.

A final decision was reached through team voting, resulting in the selection of **Wheels: a centralized carpooling application designed exclusively for Uniandes students**.

Although in a previous milestone (MS2) the team explored an application focused on restaurant discovery and coordination at Uniandes, the convergence process revealed that Wheels addressed a more recurrent and impactful need for students. The voting results reflected a shared agreement that Wheels offered greater potential for user value and for incorporating smart features based on mobile sensors and data.

# Personas

Based on the empathy maps and insights gathered during the user research phase, we identified recurring behavioral patterns, needs, and motivations among users. As a result, we decided to classify the users into three representative personas that capture the main roles within the Wheels Uniandes ecosystem: Student Driver, Student Passenger, and Student Passenger/Driver:

## Persona 1  
**Student Passenger**  
**Description:** The Student Passenger depends on carpooling as a regular way of getting to campus, especially when public transportation feels too slow, crowded, or unsafe. She often starts her day early and wants a commute that feels predictable and calm, without having to send multiple messages or wait for replies in busy WhatsApp groups. Uncertainty about pickup times, driver availability, or delays adds stress to her routine and affects how she plans her day. What she values most is feeling safe, informed, and on time. 

<img width="1521" height="1636" alt="Passenger" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15956dd5-5622-4290-857f-a3d9ae8861a8" />

---

## Persona 2  
**Student Driver**  
**Description:** The Student Driver is a Uniandes student who usually goes to campus by car and often has empty seats during the trip. Offering rides to other students helps them reduce fuel and parking costs, but only if it doesn’t make their commute more complicated or stressful. Right now, they rely on WhatsApp groups to coordinate rides, which often leads to last-minute changes, uncertainty about whether passengers will arrive on time, and awkward payment situations. They care about efficiency and fairness, and they want to feel confident  that the users will pay.

## Persona 3  
**Student Passenger / Driver (Hybrid)**  
**Description:** The Student Passenger / Driver moves between being a driver and a passenger depending on the day, their schedule, and whether they have access to a car. Some days they are happy to offer rides and share costs, while on others they prefer to ride with someone else to save time or money. This flexibility makes informal coordination difficult, as switching roles repeatedly in WhatsApp groups can become confusing and inefficient. They want a system that adapts to their changing needs without requiring extra effort or explanation.

# Description of the Solution

Wheels is a **student-to-student mobility service** designed to help university students commute from home to campus at a much lower cost per trip than traditional transportation options. The platform centralizes everything in a single app, replacing informal and disorganized ride arrangements with a structured, reliable system.

Through Wheels, student drivers can offer rides while passengers can join trips based on availability, location, and schedule. The app integrates **real-time location tracking** to monitor routes, detect arrivals, and confirm when users reach pickup and drop-off points, reducing confusion and uncertainty.

To address common issues such as late payments and delays, Wheels includes a **Reliability and Rewards system** that tracks punctual arrivals, waiting behavior, and on-time payments. Responsible users are rewarded, while unreliable behavior is discouraged through transparent feedback rather than punishment.

By focusing on coordination, fairness, and trust, Wheels improves the shared ride experience for both drivers and passengers, making student commuting more affordable, organized, and stress-free.

The diagram below gives an overview of how Wheels works and how the main parts of the system connect to each other. It shows how drivers and passengers interact through the app to coordinate rides, how trips are followed in real time, and how reliability and rewards are built from what happens during each ride:
