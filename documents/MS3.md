# Brainstorming Process

The brainstorming process started by identifying common mobility problems faced by university students when commuting from home to campus. As a group, we discussed existing informal solutions where students offer rides to other students at lower prices than traditional transportation options.

Each idea was proposed openly and discussed in terms of feasibility, value for students, and potential to solve recurring issues such as lack of payment, poor coordination, delays, and unclear communication. After the discussion, we shortlisted the most promising ideas.

We then organized these ideas using a simple clustering method, comparing their potential impact and feasibility. This process helped us define a clear direction for the decision-making stage.

# Decision Process

The final idea for the semester, **Wheels**, was selected using a divergence and convergence method. Initially, the team explored multiple alternatives, encouraging feedback through the *Yes, and* technique to maintain a collaborative and respectful environment.

After this divergence phase, ideas were filtered and classified based on **impact** (high or low) and **effort** (high or low). The final selection was made through a group vote. Wheels was chosen because it directly addresses a real and recurring problem among students, with high potential impact and strong social value.

# Description of the Solution

Wheels is a **student-to-student mobility service** designed to help university students commute from home to campus at a much lower cost per trip than traditional transportation options. The platform centralizes everything in a single app, replacing informal and disorganized ride arrangements with a structured, reliable system.

Through Wheels, student drivers can offer rides while passengers can join trips based on availability, location, and schedule. The app integrates **real-time location tracking** to monitor routes, detect arrivals, and confirm when users reach pickup and drop-off points, reducing confusion and uncertainty.

To address common issues such as late payments and delays, Wheels includes a **Reliability and Rewards system** that tracks punctual arrivals, waiting behavior, and on-time payments. Responsible users are rewarded, while unreliable behavior is discouraged through transparent feedback rather than punishment.

By focusing on coordination, fairness, and trust, Wheels improves the shared ride experience for both drivers and passengers, making student commuting more affordable, organized, and stress-free.
