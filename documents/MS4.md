# Problem & Solution Description
#### Problem Description
University students often face daily mobility challenges that make commuting to campus expensive, disorganized, and stressful. Many rely on public transportation or ride-hailing services that, over time, consume a significant portion of their monthly budget. Informal ride arrangements between students usually happen through messaging apps or social media, which leads to last-minute cancellations, miscommunication, payment delays, uncertainty about arrival times, and safety concerns. Additionally, there is often a lack of trust and accountability between drivers and passengers, making shared commuting unreliable and frustrating for both sides.

#### Proposed Solution
Wheels is a structured, student-to-student mobility platform designed to make commuting more affordable, coordinated, and trustworthy. The app centralizes ride scheduling, seat availability, and payments in a single system, eliminating informal and disorganized arrangements. With real-time location tracking, automated notifications, verified university profiles, and a Reliability and Rewards system, Wheels encourages punctuality, responsible behavior, and fairness. By improving coordination, transparency, and trust, Wheels transforms the student commuting experience into a more efficient, safe, and stress-free solution.

# Problems-Alternative-Solutions (PAS)
| ID | Problem | Alternative | Solution |
|----|----------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | Many university students spend a large portion of their monthly budget on transportation to campus. | They use public transportation or ride-hailing apps despite the high cumulative cost. | Wheels provides a student-to-student ride-sharing platform with significantly lower per-trip costs. |
| 2 | Informal ride coordination between students is disorganized and unreliable. | Students arrange rides through WhatsApp or social media, leading to confusion and cancellations. | Wheels centralizes ride scheduling and confirmations in one structured app. |
| 3 | Students often feel uncertain about pickup times and arrival estimates. | They constantly message or call the driver for updates. | Wheels integrates real-time location tracking to monitor routes and confirm arrivals. |
| 4 | Drivers experience delayed or incomplete payments from passengers. | They demand cash upfront or stop offering rides. | Wheels includes integrated payment tracking and reliability scoring for on-time payments. |
| 5 | Passengers frequently deal with late drivers and excessive waiting times. | They return to more expensive but predictable transportation services. | Wheels implements a Reliability and Rewards system that encourages punctuality. |
| 6 | There is a lack of trust between student drivers and passengers. | Students prefer commuting alone or using impersonal transportation services. | Wheels verifies university profiles and includes transparent reliability feedback metrics. |
| 7 | Students are unaware of peers traveling similar routes at similar times. | They assume no ride is available and use alternative transport. | Wheels allows users to filter rides by schedule, location, and availability. |
| 8 | Drivers often travel with empty seats, missing the opportunity to share costs. | They absorb the full fuel and transportation expense. | Wheels allows drivers to publish available seats and match with students heading the same way. |
| 9 | Last-minute changes create stress and miscommunication between users. | Students rely on repeated messaging or cancel trips. | Wheels sends automated notifications and real-time updates to reduce confusion. |
| 10 | Students feel commuting is stressful due to unpredictability and lack of structure. | They tolerate inefficient systems or overpay for convenience. | Wheels improves coordination through structured bookings and route monitoring. |
| 11 | Some students worry about safety when sharing rides informally. | They avoid shared rides and use crowded public transport instead. | Wheels provides verified student-only access and real-time trip tracking for increased safety. |
| 12 | Students who behave responsibly receive no recognition compared to unreliable users. | Good users feel unmotivated and stop participating actively. | Wheels includes a Reliability and Rewards system that incentivizes punctual arrivals and responsible behavior. |
