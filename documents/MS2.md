## 📝 Interview Questions & Responses

| # | Question | Purpose | Response |
|---|---------|---------|---------|
| 1 | So please introduce yourself. Who are you? |To understand the interviewee’s general waste management habits and set a behavioral baseline| My name is Daniela Solarte. I am 23 years old, and I study Industrial Engineering at Universidad de Los Andes. I am in my seventh semester, and that’s about it. |
| 2 | Can you tell me a little about how you usually handle waste in your daily life? |To understand the interviewee’s general waste management habits and set a behavioral baseline. | Well, at home what we do is that we have two different bags, and that’s what we usually do.|
| 3 | What kinds of materials do you normally separate or recycle at home? |To identify which materials the interviewee feels confident recycling and where knowledge gaps exist. |In one of the bags, we usually put cardboard, plastic, plastic bottles, glass, and that type of material. In the other one, we usually put organic waste. That is about it. |
| 4 | How would you describe your experience with recycling in Bogotá so far? | To capture perceptions of the local recycling ecosystem and systemic challenges. |I would say my experience is pretty standard. We usually separate these two types of waste, and then I throw them in the garbage disposal in my building. Then they put it outside for the trash collectors to take it.|
| 5 | What do you usually do with waste that is not easy to recycle, such as cables, electronics, batteries, light bulbs, or tetrapack? | To understand real behaviors when facing complex or uncommon waste. | I don’t usually dispose of those types of materials because I don’t really know where they would go. I know there are public places where you can put used batteries, but I usually just keep them in my drawer.|
| 6 | How do you usually find information about where or how to recycle those types of materials? | To identify information sources and evaluate trust and accessibility issues. |If I want to know how to recycle something that I don’t know how to handle, I usually search on the internet. There are also posts on Instagram or videos where they explain how to manage those types of waste.|
| 7 | Can you tell me more about those sites? | To deepen understanding of the information channels the interviewee relies on.|I think about oil. At home, we usually don’t know what to do with used cooking oil, so we just pour it down the drain, but that’s not good. I once saw that Instagram reel I mentioned before, and they said they also take that type of waste and dispose of it properly. This situation happens very often, and I’m sure many people don’t know what to do with it, so they just pour it down the drain. | 
| 8 | Can you describe a situation where you were unsure about how or where to properly dispose of a specific type of waste? |To uncover real-life experiences that reveal uncertainty and pain points in recycling.|I think about oil. At home, we usually don’t know what to do with used cooking oil, so we just pour it down the drain, but that’s not good. I once saw that Instagram reel I mentioned before, and they said they also take that type of waste and dispose of it properly. This situation happens very often, and I’m sure many people don’t know what to do with it, so they just pour it down the drain.|
| 9 | What do you find most difficult about recycling properly? | To identify the main challenges and barriers the interviewee faces when recycling.| I think the most difficult part is that in public spaces there are several trash cans, but we don’t really know where to put things. They show little drawings, but I’m still unsure sometimes. In my building, they don’t really specify what goes into recycling and what goes into organic waste. There isn’t enough information to do it properly.|
| 10 | When information about recycling is unclear or hard to find, what do you usually do? | To understand the interviewee’s behavior when facing uncertainty or lack of guidance. |When information isn’t clear, I usually put the waste in whatever bin I can. Sometimes, like with cables or batteries, I just keep them in my house because I have no idea where to dispose of them.|
| 11 | Just to make sure I understood correctly, would you say that one of the main challenges is knowing where to take specific types of waste? | To validate the interviewer’s interpretation of the interviewee’s previous answers. |Yes, of course. I’d say that’s the main issue, and also that there isn’t enough information for people in general.|
| 12 |On a scale from one to ten, how would you rate convenience when deciding whether or not to recycle something?| To assess the importance of convenience in recycling-related decision making. |I’d give it an eight. I think it’s very important because when recycling is easy and convenient, we’re more likely to do it.|
| 13 | What kind of information would help you recycle more confidently? | To identify information needs that could increase confidence in recycling behavior. | Any type of information would help, especially educational videos, ads, or Instagram posts. They’re very accessible and can give important information in a summarized way.|
| 14 | Would having clear guidance on how to properly dispose of different materials be helpful for you?| To evaluate the perceived value of clear guidance and educational support. |Yes, I think that would be very good. It would reduce the hesitation I have and help the planet as well.|
| 15 |What motivates you to recycle, and what discourages you the most from doing it consistently? | To uncover motivational and discouraging factors influencing recycling habits. |What motivates me is helping the planet and future generations. What discourages me is feeling that my effort doesn’t really make a difference in the bigger picture. It’s also sometimes confusing or inconvenient to recycle things like cables and electronics.|
| 16 |If recycling were easier for you, what would need to change in your daily routine or environment? |To explore ideal conditions and unmet needs without suggesting a specific solution. | Recycling would be easier if I didn’t have to think so much about it. If information and locations were obvious and nearby, it would feel like a natural part of my day.|
| 17 | Is there anything important about recycling that we haven’t talked about and that you think is worth mentioning? | To give the interviewee an open space to share additional insights or concerns.|I think most people are willing to recycle. The system just isn’t designed to make it easy. In Bogotá, compared to countries like Japan, there aren’t many consequences for disposing of waste incorrectly. Maybe if there were more consequences, people would be more educated and recycling would improve.|

## 💡 Insights – What? How? Why? Who?

### 🔹 Insight 1: Transportation is a major barrier to donating clothes
- **What?**
  The users may accumulate bags of clothes at home and eventually leave them near trash areas or for recyclers.
- **How?**
  They act pragmatically and prioritize convenience when clothes become an obstacle in their daily space.
- **Why?**
  Because donation centers are far away and transporting large amounts of clothing is inconvenient.
- **Who?**
  Urban adults with limited time, no easy access to transportation, and busy routines.

---

### 🔹 Insight 2: Trust in the correct use of donations influences user behavior
- **What?**
  The users may donate clothes but observe that many items quickly end up as waste in public spaces.
- **How?**
  They feel frustrated and discouraged when donations lead to pollution instead of positive impact.
- **Why?**
  Because users want assurance that their donations are being used responsibly.
- **Who?**
  Environmentally aware users who care about the social and environmental outcomes of their actions.

---

### 🔹 Insight 3: Cultural norms limit donation and second-hand clothing adoption
- **What?**
  Some users avoid donating worn clothes and do not buy second-hand clothing.
- **How?**
  They judge clothing based on condition and newness, often undervaluing reuse.
- **Why?**
  Because cultural beliefs associate new clothing with value, dignity, and status.
- **Who?**
  Users raised in traditional households where second-hand clothing is not normalized.

---

### 🔹 Insight 4: Reframing donation as transformation increases motivation
- **What?**
  The users might respond positively to the idea of clothes being transformed into new or artistic products.
- **How?**
  They feel more motivated when donations are seen as creative reuse rather than disposal.
- **Why?**
  Because transformation adds meaning and reduces the feeling of giving away “old” items.

# 💡Brainstorming Process

The brainstorming process was carried out in Spanish with authorization of the Instructor to facilitate the ideation process and ease the communication. Hence, the pictures will be presented in Spanish.

## Wheels Uniandes
Following the tips and instructions given in C2, during our brainstorming process we decided to use post-it notes as a way to quickly externalize our ideas. Based on the insights gathered from our interviews and analysis, we began writing down potential solutions and concepts and placing them on the desk, as shown in the photo. This allowed us to visually organize our thoughts, build on each other’s ideas, and encourage an open and collaborative discussion.

After generating a wide range of ideas, we organized them into four categories to better evaluate their potential: Rational Choices, The Most Likely to Delight, The Darling, and The Long Shot. This classification helped us compare ideas based on feasibility, user impact, and level of innovation, and allowed us to prioritize which concepts were worth exploring further.

Finally after evaluating both projects we decided to prototype the Car Pooling Proyect (Wheels Uniandes) because we found that the problems were beign very painfull for both drivers and users. This way the key ideas we found were the following:
- Driver and user reviews are key in order to make a better service
- Having an organized platform without adds were people can enter and find services without belonging to a ton of Whastapp groups
- Having a quick payment button can make things way faster and easier for users
- Enforcing a tough cancellation policy can help drivers avoid last minute cancellations
- Showing drivers location and route will make the service more efficient.

## University Gastronomic Offer (Restaurants)

Following the same approach we used for the *Wheels Uniandes* problematic, we started the process by **diverging ideas**, focusing more on **quantity than quality**. During this stage, we tried to avoid opinions that included the word *“but”* and instead focused on **building on top of existing ideas**. We also explored ideas related to **wearables, physical elements, and IoT technologies** to expand the range of possible solutions. This brainstorming process is shown in the image below:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11789185-5da2-45c7-a5b9-ae120baaaecc" alt="drawing" width="800"/>

After that, we moved into a **convergence phase**, where we grouped the ideas into the four categories defined earlier. Most ideas clearly fit into one category, but one stood out: using **GPS sensors on mobile phones to detect congestion at food points on campus**. We considered this idea to be both **“The Darling”** and **“The Long Shot”**, since it was an idea we really liked as a team but also one that would be challenging to implement and make work properly. This convergence process is illustrated in the next image:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f510fb08-d4a1-4244-aaf0-cad5b90c6a95" alt="drawing" width="800"/>

The main ideas we identified were:

* Restaurant reviews
* Filtering restaurants by price and category
* Showing menus and prices clearly
* A campus map with the location of restaurants

However, as mentioned before, the final solution for this project will not focus on the food-point problem. Instead, the methodology and insights from this exercise will be applied to the **carpooling problem at the university.

# 🎥 Prototype (Video)

In the following link, you can find the video presenting the prototype (blueprint) of our solution for the university carpooling problem (Wheels Uniandes). The proposal incorporates key ideas from the brainstorming process, such as user and driver reviews, a clean and organized platform without ads or multiple WhatsApp groups, quick in-app payments, clear cancellation policies, and real-time visibility of drivers’ routes. All team members participated in the video, each explaining at least one aspect of the solution using wireframes designed in Figma.
