## 📝 Interview Questions & Responses

| # | Question | Purpose | Response |
|---|---------|---------|---------|
| 1 | So please introduce yourself. Who are you? |To understand the interviewee’s general waste management habits and set a behavioral baseline| My name is Daniela Solarte. I am 23 years old, and I study Industrial Engineering at Universidad de Los Andes. I am in my seventh semester, and that’s about it. |
| 2 | Can you tell me a little about how you usually handle waste in your daily life? |To understand the interviewee’s general waste management habits and set a behavioral baseline. | Well, at home what we do is that we have two different bags, and that’s what we usually do.|
| 3 | What kinds of materials do you normally separate or recycle at home? |To identify which materials the interviewee feels confident recycling and where knowledge gaps exist. |In one of the bags, we usually put cardboard, plastic, plastic bottles, glass, and that type of material. In the other one, we usually put organic waste. That is about it. |
| 4 | How would you describe your experience with recycling in Bogotá so far? | To capture perceptions of the local recycling ecosystem and systemic challenges. |I would say my experience is pretty standard. We usually separate these two types of waste, and then I throw them in the garbage disposal in my building. Then they put it outside for the trash collectors to take it.|
| 5 | What do you usually do with waste that is not easy to recycle, such as cables, electronics, batteries, light bulbs, or tetrapack? | To understand real behaviors when facing complex or uncommon waste. | I don’t usually dispose of those types of materials because I don’t really know where they would go. I know there are public places where you can put used batteries, but I usually just keep them in my drawer.|
| 6 | How do you usually find information about where or how to recycle those types of materials? | To identify information sources and evaluate trust and accessibility issues. |If I want to know how to recycle something that I don’t know how to handle, I usually search on the internet. There are also posts on Instagram or videos where they explain how to manage those types of waste.|
| 7 | Can you tell me more about those sites? | To deepen understanding of the information channels the interviewee relies on.|I think about oil. At home, we usually don’t know what to do with used cooking oil, so we just pour it down the drain, but that’s not good. I once saw that Instagram reel I mentioned before, and they said they also take that type of waste and dispose of it properly. This situation happens very often, and I’m sure many people don’t know what to do with it, so they just pour it down the drain. | 
| 8 | Can you describe a situation where you were unsure about how or where to properly dispose of a specific type of waste? |To uncover real-life experiences that reveal uncertainty and pain points in recycling.|I think about oil. At home, we usually don’t know what to do with used cooking oil, so we just pour it down the drain, but that’s not good. I once saw that Instagram reel I mentioned before, and they said they also take that type of waste and dispose of it properly. This situation happens very often, and I’m sure many people don’t know what to do with it, so they just pour it down the drain.|
| 9 | What do you find most difficult about recycling properly? | To identify the main challenges and barriers the interviewee faces when recycling.| I think the most difficult part is that in public spaces there are several trash cans, but we don’t really know where to put things. They show little drawings, but I’m still unsure sometimes. In my building, they don’t really specify what goes into recycling and what goes into organic waste. There isn’t enough information to do it properly.|
| 10 | When information about recycling is unclear or hard to find, what do you usually do? | To understand the interviewee’s behavior when facing uncertainty or lack of guidance. |When information isn’t clear, I usually put the waste in whatever bin I can. Sometimes, like with cables or batteries, I just keep them in my house because I have no idea where to dispose of them.|
| 11 | Just to make sure I understood correctly, would you say that one of the main challenges is knowing where to take specific types of waste? | To validate the interviewer’s interpretation of the interviewee’s previous answers. |Yes, of course. I’d say that’s the main issue, and also that there isn’t enough information for people in general.|
| 12 |On a scale from one to ten, how would you rate convenience when deciding whether or not to recycle something?| To assess the importance of convenience in recycling-related decision making. |I’d give it an eight. I think it’s very important because when recycling is easy and convenient, we’re more likely to do it.|
| 13 | What kind of information would help you recycle more confidently? | To identify information needs that could increase confidence in recycling behavior. | Any type of information would help, especially educational videos, ads, or Instagram posts. They’re very accessible and can give important information in a summarized way.|
| 14 | Would having clear guidance on how to properly dispose of different materials be helpful for you?| To evaluate the perceived value of clear guidance and educational support. |Yes, I think that would be very good. It would reduce the hesitation I have and help the planet as well.|
| 15 |What motivates you to recycle, and what discourages you the most from doing it consistently? | To uncover motivational and discouraging factors influencing recycling habits. |What motivates me is helping the planet and future generations. What discourages me is feeling that my effort doesn’t really make a difference in the bigger picture. It’s also sometimes confusing or inconvenient to recycle things like cables and electronics.|
| 16 |If recycling were easier for you, what would need to change in your daily routine or environment? |To explore ideal conditions and unmet needs without suggesting a specific solution. | Recycling would be easier if I didn’t have to think so much about it. If information and locations were obvious and nearby, it would feel like a natural part of my day.|
| 17 | Is there anything important about recycling that we haven’t talked about and that you think is worth mentioning? | To give the interviewee an open space to share additional insights or concerns.|I think most people are willing to recycle. The system just isn’t designed to make it easy. In Bogotá, compared to countries like Japan, there aren’t many consequences for disposing of waste incorrectly. Maybe if there were more consequences, people would be more educated and recycling would improve.|
