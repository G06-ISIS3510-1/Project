# 1) One Defined Idea (Single Solution)

**Wheels is a university-exclusive ride-sharing platform that connects verified students inside the same campus community to coordinate safe, reliable and cost-efficient rides, with two tailored experiences: Passenger and Driver.**

Wheels is built around **trust-by-design**: only verified university members can access the platform, reducing uncertainty and increasing safety during ride coordination and financial transactions.

The system includes:
- A **Passenger interface** for searching and joining rides.
- A **Driver interface** for publishing rides and managing earnings.

This dual-experience approach reinforces clarity of roles and optimizes the UX for each user type.

# 2) Value Proposition

## For Passengers
- Safer rides within a **verified university network**
- Lower cost compared to traditional ride-hailing
- Higher reliability for recurring routes (home–campus–events)
- Transparent ride information and ratings

## For Drivers
- Flexible income from trips they already make
- Reduced cancellation risk through verified users
- Clear financial transparency (earnings, ride history, states)
- Reputation system that reinforces accountability

## Key Differentiators

1. Closed community (university verification required)
2. Driver-centered financial clarity
3. Mobility optimized for student routines
4. Community-based trust model

> **Wheels delivers safe, verified student mobility with transparent earnings and community-based accountability.**

# 3) UI/UX Design System (Material + Flat Design)

The design follows **Material Design** and **Flat Design** principles, ensuring it is aligned with mobile application standards and not web-only interaction patterns.
